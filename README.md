## Description 
Note taker is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. The motivation behind this application was to create a simple and efficient way for the user to take peristent notes while allowing for the written information to be available when needed. 



## Credits
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework was used to create routes, create route handlers, handle errors, serve static files, as well as use middleware for additional request processing. 

[Path](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path) module was used in working with directories and file paths. 

A link to the [Note Taker]() application is deployed on Heroku.
